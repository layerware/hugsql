# HugSQL Adapter for next.jdbc

## Usage

Below is an example, you can find other ways to do this in the [HugSQL documentation](https://www.hugsql.org/#adapter-other). 

```clojure
(ns my-app
  (:require [hugsql.core :as hugsql]
            [hugsql.adapter.next-jdbc :as next-adapter]))

(defn app-init []
  (hugsql/set-adapter! (next-adapter/hugsql-adapter-next-jdbc)))
```

You can pass in default command options to the adapter via the one-arity version. For example:

```clojure
(hugsql/set-adapter! (next-adapter/hugsql-adapter-next-jdbc {:builder-fn result-set/as-unqualified-maps}))
```
